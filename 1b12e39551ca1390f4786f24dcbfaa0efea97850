      "message": "This ifdef isn\u0027t being used since we have the same code anyway. While this could stay here to let us know that the code is needed in the USE_ALP_AUDIO case, even the justification/comment for why we need it is different (I mean, what this comment says is different a different reason from what the justification for our introduction of it is: https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_frameworks_av/commit/ae3484485210d16e397fd007ac928c97cef5842a ). Thus, I\u0027d recommend we ditch both the commented ifdef and the comment before of the variable attribution, or otherwise rephrase the comment.",

      "message": "I actually beg to differ here.\nI think the way it is right now makes more sense, because the commit that introduced this previously is still available as such and is portable on its own, even without this commit. However, to have the same level of code portability here, we need to put the ifdefs anyways, despite them being used or not, because otherwise this commit wouldn\u0027t be applicable on top of a branch lacking the aforementioned commit that introduced this code first.",
