While this could stay here to let us know that the code is needed in the USE_ALP_AUDIO case, even the justification/comment for why we need it is different (I mean, what this comment says is different a different reason from what the justification for our introduction of it is: https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_frameworks_av/commit/ae3484485210d16e397fd007ac928c97cef5842a ). Thus, I\u0027d recommend we ditch both the commented ifdef and the comment before of the variable attribution, or otherwise rephrase the comment.",
