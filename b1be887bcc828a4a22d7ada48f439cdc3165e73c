Before changing the loaded file this patch checks wether the new file exists and if it does not the regular config will be loaded, so it does not change the behaviour for devices which do not ship _vendor variants of the media codecs. I have verified that media_codecs_shima_v1.xml is loaded (like it does without this patch) if media_codecs_shima_v1_vendor.xml does not exist.",
